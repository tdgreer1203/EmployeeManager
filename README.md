  ## Description
------
After learning Node and Express, I wanted to create a Node application to strengthen my knowledge of MySQL2. I was able to grasp the concepts of express fairly quickly, and understood the concept of routing very well. When I began creating this application, I immediately went to creating it as an Express app. After further analyzing the requirements, I determined this app should not use Express. The problem there was, I had not created an app with a MySQL backend without using Express, so this was a very good app for me to practice my Node concepts, and my understanding of MySQL.

The goal of this project was to see if I would conceptualize how to build this app, and begin building it based on the principles that had been taught to us so far in the bootcamp. Although I struggled in the beginning, I was able to figure out how to get this application designed and built without using Express. Many of the solutions here are "long-handed", but at this point in the bootcamp, we had not yet began learning the "easier" way to do things. 

This project allows a person to create a company profile that consists of positions, departments, and employees. The person can manage each of these pieces of their company using the app. An entity of each piece can be added, and a list of all can be viewed. There is also an optoin to update the position of an employee.

Completing this project helped me understand the differences in design structure between an app that uses Express, and an app that doesn't. This app also gave me the chance to further my understanding of Inquirer, and write some fairly involved MySQL queries.

## Installation
------
To install the app, simply download the app, then be sure to run the "npm install" command to get the needed dependencies. Once that is done, you can run the "node index.js" command to run the app.



## Useage
------
To use the app, simply answer the questions that are asked once it is run. When the app is started, you will be presented with a "main menu". At the main menu, you will be given a list of tasks you can complete using this app. Just select the task you want to perform, and answer the questions related to that task.
